# Data-Challenge-KBTG
Data prediction challenges for Techjam Online Audition by KBTG

## Challenges Description
1. Predict NPL (Non-Performing Loan) from credit card information
2. Merchant Prediction
3. Churn Detection with Accountâ€™s Activities and Transactions
4. Account Type Prediction from Deposit Transactions
5. Gender Prediction from Credit Card Transactions

## Software used for creating model:
- Jupyter Notebook in local machine
- Jupyter Notebook in DataScientist Workbench

## Programming Tools:
- Python 3
- Python Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost

## Model file:
- For each question 1-5, there is 1 Jupyter Notebook file for the model named "Wrangling Q_"
- Q1-4 used Scikit-learn 18 (in local machine)
- Q5 used Scikit-learn 17 and XGBoost (in DataScientist Workbench)

### More notes about Q5:
The transaction data is loaded in MySQL, then features are extracted with the following SQL:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT(card_no),
AVG(txn_amount) AS avg_txn,
MAX(txn_amount) AS max_txn,
MIN(txn_amount) AS min_txn,
MAX(mer_cat_code) AS max_cat_code
CASE 
    WHEN (AVG(txn_hour) >= 9 AND AVG(txn_hour) <= 18)
               THEN 1
               ELSE 0 
    END as pay_when_work,
CASE 
    WHEN SUM(mer_id) > 0
               THEN 1
               ELSE 0 
    END as has_mer_id
FROM transactions t1
WHERE txn_date = '2016-08-03'
GROUP BY card_no
```
and buy_men, buy_women, buy_cosmetic features are extracted in this fashion:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT(card_no),
1 AS buy_men
FROM transactions
WHERE mer_cat_code IN ('5621', '5631')
```
